  <h1>Modders Against Blockers</h1>
  <strong>TODO: Add simple site explanation</strong>
  <h2>How to use Modders Against Blockers</h2>
  <p>Give a link to the repo running this site.</p>
  <p>Add instructions on how to add your own images to this site.</p>
  <h2>Why does this site exist</h2>
  <p>Talk about uBlock, and explain the story. Might need another page for that :eyes:</p>
  <h2>Technicals</h2>
  <p>Explain how this site works, and why ad blockers can't really block ads from this repo</p>
  <h2>Maintainers</h2>
  <p>Add a list of maintainers for Modders Against Blockers</p>
  <h2>Sponsor</h2>
  <p>This will be once everything else is done. However, we should add an ad, maybe for Modrinth. Which uses the same system, just to make fun of ad blockers</p>
  <!-- Add cool generated footer that links to all mod pages using this system -->
